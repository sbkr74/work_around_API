Great! Let’s focus on **Requirement Gathering** and then prepare the **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** for your math quiz app, inspired by platforms like **Testbook**. Testbook is a popular competitive exam preparation platform, so we’ll aim to include similar features while tailoring them for a math quiz app.
